Spring is in full swing, and we'll round the bases with head coach Ryan Jacobs talking UNI softball as they hit the meat of their conference schedule. We preview one of the best ways to get most amazing Panther gear in the coming month, hear from a recent UNI Hall of Fame inductee, look towards the end of the golf season, and see what UNI football's focusing on this spring.

Watch Panther Sports Talk in eastern Iowa, on KFXA FOX 28, at 10pm-Friday's and 11:30am-Saturday's.
