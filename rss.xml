            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Show 34 | April 1</h1><p>Today we recap the amazing season of the UNI men's basketball team. We look at the NCAA Tournament games that includes the shot of the tourney by our very own Paul Jesperson. We look at how the Panther men have handled themselves since the crushing defeat that ended their season, and we see how they stayed relaxed and got some extra motivation during their week in the national spotlight. It's an NCAA tournament special, and it starts right now.</p></article>]]></description>
